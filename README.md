# Git Workflow

**Author:** _Callie Enfield_

**Due date:** _February 4, 2016_

## Description

_We were expected to clone and edit README.md._

## What I Learned from This

_I learned how to clone to my local desktop and edit the code.  I learned that it wouldn't produce my text without taking away the outside brackets and stuff._

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

_Callie Enfield_
